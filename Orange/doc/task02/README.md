# Task 02

## Comparison Agile/Waterfall

We compare the agile and waterfall method considering

+ Findings from first analysis
+ Customer and Users
+ Our Team and available times / resources
+ some other aspects

| Agile                                 | Wasserfall                                                               |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| requirements management               | critical points in the project require detailed and mature specifications|
| continuous quality improvement        | rather less "try-and-error"                                              |
| **better resource management**        | better cost overview                                                     |
| **always a running software**         | specification has better quality                                         |
| exchange of knowledge                 | scopes are clearer                                                       |
|                                       |                                                                          |

## Project method decision

We have decided to use **agile method** for implementing the MHC-PMS.

The most important value for this decision was the increment development and delivery. 
Since we got a limited time span for such an extensive project, we have to make sure we are able to 
implement at least the “Critical success factor” (CSF is defined in Task01). The best way to guarantee this, 
is to develop features iterative, so we won’t have an incomplete project which is also not working. 

Our team is mostly working on the project separated, which makes it much difficult to have a working-progress 
overview. An agile process will give us a frequent visibility into the project’s progress. It also helps to identify
and solve any issues early, and prevents big refactoring work later.

We all are in various field active, what brings us different point of views on problem/solution, as well as individual 
know-how. In a waterfall model, those things can get lost easily. We first plan everything to the end and assign each
task to someone, and then everyone is just focusing on finishing their own job. In an agile way of working, there is 
more interaction between the developers. We can discuss our problems and the solutions together, and can exchange our 
knowledge very easily.
