## Comparison Agile/Waterfall

We compare the agile and waterfall method considering

+ Findings from first analysis
+ Customer and Users
+ Our Team and available times / resources
+ some other aspects

| Agile                                 | Wasserfall                                                               |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| requirements management               | critical points in the project require detailed and mature specifications|
| continuous quality improvement        | rather less "try-and-error"                                              |
| **better resource management**        | better cost overview                                                     |
| **always a running software**         | specification has better quality                                         |
| exchange of knowledge                 | scopes are clearer                                                       |
|                                       |                                                                          |
