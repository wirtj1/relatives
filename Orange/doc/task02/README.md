# Task 02

## Comparison Agile/Waterfall

We compare the agile and waterfall method considering

+ Findings from first analysis
+ Customer and Users
+ Our Team and available times / resources
+ some other aspects

### Overview

| Agile                                 | Waterfall                                                               |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| requirements management               | **critical points in the project require detailed and mature specifications**|
| continuous quality improvement        | rather less "try-and-error"                                              |
| **better resource management**        | better cost overview                                                     |
| **always a running software**         | specification has better quality                                         |
| exchange of knowledge                 | scopes are clearer                                                       |

### Pro agile

 + requirements management: We think there is almost no software without new requirements during the development process. The ability of handling them in an agile method is very valuable to us.
 + continuous quality improvement: Manipulating software artifacts multiple times during the project brings a continuous improvement whit it.
 + better resource management: Since we are part time students, it is harder to manage our resources. An agile method allows us to organize the amount of work per period in a supportive way. We are aware that this can also be a risk.
 + always a running software: Because we have clearly must have and nice to have criterias, we can minimize the risk of not being able to deliver at the end of project time.
 + exchange of knowledge: Leads to better quality and problem solving.

### Pro Waterfall

 + critical points in the project require detailed and mature specifications: Some points like data security are absolute must have. We can not take the risk of a data leak due to bad developed specification.
 + rather less "try-and-error": Similar thoughts as in the point above.
 + better cost overview: This is a more general advantage of the waterfall model. As we also mentioned some general points which we value for the agile method, we do the same for the waterfall method.
 + specification has better quality: specification often suffers in agile methods. This is also a more general point we do value.
 + scopes are clearer: The scope is clear from the beginning (full specification) and no need to discuss about what we should have done additionally.


## Project method decision

We have decided to use **agile method** for implementing the MHC-PMS.

The most important value for this decision was the increment development and delivery.
Since we got a limited time span for such an extensive project, we have to make sure we are able to
implement at least the “Critical success factor” (CSF is defined in Task01). The best way to guarantee this,
is to develop features iterative, so we won’t have an incomplete project which is also not working.

Our team is mostly working on the project separated, which makes it much difficult to have a working-progress
overview. An agile process will give us a frequent visibility into the project’s progress. It also helps to identify
and solve any issues early, and prevents big refactoring work later.

We all are in various field active, what brings us different point of views on problem/solution, as well as individual
know-how. In a waterfall model, those things can get lost easily. We first plan everything to the end and assign each
task to someone, and then everyone is just focusing on finishing their own job. In an agile way of working, there is
more interaction between the developers. We can discuss our problems and the solutions together, and can exchange our
knowledge very easily.
