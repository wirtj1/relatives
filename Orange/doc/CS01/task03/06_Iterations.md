# Iterations

## First iteration
The whole group was brain storming.
The goal is that everyone has the same understanding of this project.
Notes for the interview were made.
Research, scoping, first story boards were made.

## Second iteration
According to our progress, we updated the prepared interview questions.
Prototypes were made.

## Third iteration
After the interview, we adjusted the location tracking (only if initiatad by patient)
and added the need for notifing for medication. Additionally the patient must be able to see the _exactly_ same informations as the relatives.
After that, we polished the documentation.
