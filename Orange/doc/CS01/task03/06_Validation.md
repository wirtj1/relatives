## Evaluation questions
- Do you understand the use case from the storyboard? (Without extra explanation)
- Will you react different than our storyboard story?
- Do you think the app is no use for a function? You don’t need it for this specific task.
- Do you miss a relevant function? 
- Do you see a story as unnecessary or as not realizable?

- Do you understand the prototypes (GUI)? (Without extra explanation)
- Do you think the GUI is simple enough?
- Do you need more information/description?
- Do you know where to click for your needs?

## How to find the answer
1.	Show them our prototypes and see how they will interact with.
2.	Show them our storyboards and let them explain the story.

## Results
We presented our proto-products to our colleagues, friends and a worker in a psychiatry. We asked them our predefined evaluation questions and let them gain first experience with our prototype.
Mostly the interaction with our product met our expectation.  They understood our story as we wanted to and could have use the GUI in the right way. 
But we also got some interesting inputs, which we noticed for further work. We found out that a realtime tracking of a patient wouldn’t be possible and easy to implement as we thought. And there was a function missing, which would be very useful for worker in a psychiatry. A reminder to take the medication for the relative, who is looking after the patient is important, because it can always happen, that the patient forgot it.
